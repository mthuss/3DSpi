# 3DSpi

A 3DS port of a project from college that calculates Ï€ up to N decimal places (this version only prints up to 8) using Newton's formula.

Input code and makefile are based off the ```software-keyboard``` example from [3ds-examples](https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-examples/tree/master/input/software-keyboard)
